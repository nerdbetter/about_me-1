   <p>Sitting in a random booth of the Uspecified Diner, you find thoughts drift toward a somewhat unerving notion.
     It has been exactly two days scince you last talked on the phone with the mysterious coder -the one your intending to meet now- and you realize you never got the man's name.
   You begin scaning the front entrance nerously. Out of nowhere a man appears with the exact despription he mentioned: leather fadora, shin toned work boots,
   and a faint aura of having spent time coding javascript.</p>
